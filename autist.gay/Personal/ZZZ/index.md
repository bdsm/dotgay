# *Queen's Gambit* —  _13 May 2022_

A young round-faced girl with straight black hair enters my dream. Her name is Caroline, and she's a chess prodigy with a reputation for having psychic powers of some kind.

I walk into a claustrophobic concrete room, sit down at a tiny wooden table with a board across from her, and silently play d4. She plays d5 without blinking or breaking eye contact. 

I’m about to play c4 when she states: “You’re a lot simpler than most people think.” I pause and tilt my head at her, as if to inquire further, and she immediately takes my cue.

“Think about everyone you personally respect as a genius, everyone you look up to, everyone you love or are drawn to in some way, everyone you see any value in - whether you ultimately think they’re right or wrong. There’s a common thread.” 

Within a second or two, I, almost lazily,  come to a simple approximation. This time, we speak in perfect unison. 

“They all laugh at weird shit.” 

I jolt awake.
